1. Explain what the terminal is in your own words

What the Terminal means to me, the Terminal is like the backend of your device,
It lets you access your system without having to go through multiple applications, 
updating and removing files and like a one stop shop.


2. What is the major difference between Git and GitHub?

The difference between Git and GitHub, Git is the engine itself. Where you, as the 
developer work on locally through your device, storing any updates and changes within 
the moment. GitHub is the platform, a place where you can host your Git and establish 
a backup to the cloud, providing collaboration and an extra copy incase your local git 
runs into a issue.
